TEACHING CONTENT:
"{payload.teaching_content}"

YOUR TASK:
Create exactly 3 conceptual teaching questions relevant to teaching material and what a student might see on a test:
- Test deep understanding, not memorization
- Use the format: *Question text ending with question mark?*
- align your output formatting and the qaulity with style of example below 

EXAMPLE FORMAT 
Content: The Age of Exploration was a period between the 15th and 17th centuries when European powers expanded across the globe through sea voyages, driven by economic motives, technological advances, and cultural imperatives like spreading Christianity.

Expected Output:
1. *Why did European exploration expand so rapidly in the late 15th century, and what made this timing significant compared to earlier periods?*
2. *How did the principles of mercantilism influence the goals and outcomes of European exploration and colonization?*
3. *How did the Columbian Exchange fundamentally transform both European and non-European societies ‚Äî economically, culturally, and biologically?*

Respond with ONLY the 3 questions in the exact format shown above, numbered 1-3."""

QUESTION: "{payload.question}"

STUDENT'S EXPLANATION:
"{payload.user_explanation}"

EXAMPLE ASSESSMENT (based on Age of Exploration):
Question: Why did European exploration expand so rapidly in the late 15th century?
Student Answer: "Exploration happened because countries wanted land and they found new places and took them. They had ships and went far and people got rich."

Expected Assessment:
Mastery Score: 48/100

What You Did Well:
* ‚úÖ Recognized that European nations were seeking new land and wealth
* ‚úÖ Noted that ships were a key factor in enabling exploration

Gaps in Understanding:
* ‚ùå No mention of historical context ‚Äî why the 15th century was a turning point (e.g., Fall of Constantinople, Renaissance thought, Ottoman control of land routes)
* ‚ùå Oversimplified motivations ‚Äî didn't explain religious motives, competition among European powers, or desire for direct access to Asian trade
* ‚ùå Vague use of terms like "people got rich" without referring to the Columbian Exchange, mercantilism, or monarchial sponsorship
* ‚ùå No recognition of the impact on indigenous societies or the idea of cultural imperialism

YOUR TASK:
Assess the student's explanation and provide:

1. A mastery score out of 100 (be precise and fair)
2. What they did well (bullet points using * ‚úÖ format)
3. Gaps in understanding (bullet points using * ‚ùå format)

Focus on:
- Conceptual accuracy and depth
- Use of appropriate terminology
- Recognition of complexity and nuance
- Ability to connect ideas

Format your response EXACTLY as:
Mastery Score: [X]/100

What You Did Well:
* ‚úÖ [specific strength]
* ‚úÖ [specific strength]

Gaps in Understanding:
* ‚ùå [specific gap with explanation]
* ‚ùå [specific gap with explanation]
* ‚ùå [specific gap with explanation]"""
