PLAN SPECIFICATIONS:
- Duration: {duration} minutes total
- Create exactly {num_blocks} focused learning blocks  
- Each block should be {block_duration} minutes long
- CRITICAL: Each block must cover ONE substantial, complete topic

TOPIC GRANULARITY REQUIREMENTS:
Each block should cover a COMPLETE, SUBSTANTIAL topic that is:
‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES (substantial but focused):
   ‚Ä¢ "Causes of the Renaissance" (not just "Economic factors")
   ‚Ä¢ "Key Renaissance Figures" (not just "Leonardo da Vinci")
   ‚Ä¢ "Photosynthesis Process" (not just "Light reactions")
   ‚Ä¢ "World War I Battles" (not just "Battle of Verdun")
   ‚Ä¢ "Cell Division Process" (not just "Prophase")
   ‚Ä¢ "Supply and Demand" (not just "Demand curves")

‚ùå AVOID (too narrow/specific):
   ‚Ä¢ Individual people (unless they're the entire subject)
   ‚Ä¢ Single events within larger processes
   ‚Ä¢ Individual steps of multi-step processes
   ‚Ä¢ Single examples of broader concepts

TOPIC SCOPE GUIDELINES:
- Each topic should take a full {block_duration} minutes of focused study
- Topics should be substantial enough to have multiple key aspects to explore
- Break down broad subjects into their major component themes/areas
- Ensure each block represents a complete learning unit that builds understanding
- Topics should be cohesive - all aspects should relate to the same central concept

AVAILABLE TECHNIQUES (choose 1-2 per block based on what's best for each specific topic):
‚Ä¢ flashcards: Spaced repetition for memorization of facts, terms, dates
‚Ä¢ feynman: Explain concepts in simple terms, teach-back method  
‚Ä¢ quiz: Active recall testing, self-assessment
‚Ä¢ blurting: Free recall without prompts, brain dumps

REQUIREMENTS:
- Each block needs a clear, substantial topic name that indicates complete learning unit
- Choose 1-2 BEST techniques for each topic based on its nature
- Focus on what will help student master this complete topic most effectively
- Each block must cover distinct, substantial content areas
- Blocks should build logically toward complete subject mastery
- Ensure comprehensive coverage by breaking subject into {num_blocks} substantial components

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH BLOCK:
1. Each description must focus entirely on the substantial topic specified in unit name
2. Include: Key definitions, concepts, and principles for this topic area
3. Important facts, examples, and applications relevant to this complete topic
4. Specific details that support comprehensive understanding of this topic
5. Focus on the most important aspects needed to master this complete topic area
6. Descriptions should support focused {block_duration}-minute study sessions
7. The collection should cover the subject comprehensively through substantial topic areas

DESCRIPTION FORMAT ENFORCEMENT:
- For EACH block's "description", write an ordered, numbered list of **4-6** key aspects
- Format: "<Major aspect>: <comprehensive explanation with key details (~12-20 words)>"
- Keep items focused on the block's substantial topic - comprehensive coverage of that topic
- Cover the MOST IMPORTANT aspects needed to master this complete topic area
- Include relevant equations, definitions, examples, key facts for THIS topic comprehensively
- The ENTIRE description should be numbered list only, 100-180 words total per block
- Ensure every item supports complete understanding of the substantial topic

Create a study plan with exactly {num_blocks} blocks of {block_duration} minutes each, where each block focuses on mastering one substantial, complete topic area that requires the full time allocation."""

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Return ONLY JSON data conforming to the schema, never the schema itself.
2. Output ONLY valid JSON format with proper escaping.
3. Use double quotes, escape internal quotes as \".
4. Use \\n for line breaks within content.
5. No trailing commas.
6. Each block must cover a substantial, complete topic (not overly narrow sub-components).
7. Topics should be significant enough to justify the allocated study time.
8. Break subjects into major component areas, themes, or processes - not individual details.
